# Digits_Classification_MNIST
Used MNSIT dataset Image Classification which is one of the most common datasets used for image classification.Implemented Multi-Layer Perceptron from scratch using the NumPy package to solve MNIST digits classification. Explored Xavier Initialization for weights of dense layers and RMSProp Optimizer for the gradient descent.
